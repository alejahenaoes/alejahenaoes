## Hi, I'm Aleja 🤝
I'm an 18 Colombian full-time learner, project manager and dev girl 🦄

I was part of the first cohort in [@Protalentolatam](https://protalento.org) and received a scholarship from the first Colombian crypto artist [@soyfira](https://www.instagram.com/soyfira/?hl=es-la) in [Platzi](https://platzi.com/home)

I'm curious and I like to learn new things everyday
